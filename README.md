Subnet Calculator is a simple tool to calculate subnets based on a given IP address and the number of desired subnets. This tool primarily focuses on IPv4 addressing.

## Features

- Calculate subnet mask based on desired subnets.
- List all possible subnets.
- Determine valid host ranges and broadcast address for each subnet.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- A machine running a Unix-like OS or Windows.
- Basic knowledge of IP addressing.

## Usage

- Run the program: `python subnet_calc.py` (Note: Ensure it has execute permissions)
